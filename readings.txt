How to measure legislative district compactness if you only know it when you see it
https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/compact.pdf
Verdict: Not really relevant, *except* for a chunk of the paper when the authors show how a number of leading measures of compactness rank the same four geographies differently...sometimes vastly differently. If we end up using a measure of compactness in aggregating geographies, then we must think critically about this.

(14) Measuring compactness
https://fisherzachary.github.io/public/r-output.html
Verdict: A useful, readable overview of the most common measures of compactness. I liek.
