- Abstract proposing a systemic study of the quality of newest CTPP data release at all available geographies
- Propose a new app enabling users to dynamically compute and display CVs for any dataset
- Part of a suite of tools for judicious data use: first choose your geography, then choose the way you categorize, classify, and display that geography

Benefits of proposed work include:
	a. Expose conference attendees to the unique variables and geographies in the CTPP special tabulation
	b. Benchmark the quality of the newest CTPP release and how its reliability changes with geographic scale, distance from the city center, urban / rural contexts (DVRPC region has good variety), income? (see Spielman)
	c. Demonstrate a nationally reproducible method to programmatically evaluate and visualize the quality of ACS and CTPP data
	d. (Must cite Shiny app) Provide access to flexible tools that allow any data user to conduct a reliability analysis and categorize / map their data

2. 12/12/18
- Presentation of MOE calculator at IREG
- Complete stylistic improvements on Shiny app by this date
- Mention future goals, including evaluation of newest CTPP release and aggregating geographies

3. 02/01/19
- Further MOE calculator edits
- CV viewer

When the user uploads tabular data with GEOID, Estimate, and MOE:
	a. Parse GEOID for spatial unit, then state and/or county, as applicable. Multi-state queries?
	b. Use API to download TIGER/LINE shapefile
	c. Join tabular and shapefile by GEOID; subset for uploaded area; plot map, histogram, and summary of CVs

- Philly "NTAs"
- Select most popular ACS tables as test
- Use Spielman's heuristic to create "optimal NTAs"
- Aggregate tracts to "consensus NTAs" based on the overlap of existing neighborhood maps (majority rules!)
- Analyze differences

For each ACS table:
	a. Compute and plot estimates and CVs for optimal and consensus NTAs
	b. Look for excess smoothing (result of combining incompatible tracts) and test for differences before and after creating "NTAs"
	c. There will be other things to keep in mind here...TBD
