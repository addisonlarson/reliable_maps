- CV viewer

When the user uploads tabular data with GEOID, Estimate, and MOE:
	a. Parse GEOID for spatial unit, then state and/or county, as applicable. Multi-state queries?
	b. Use API to download TIGER/LINE shapefile
	c. Join tabular and shapefile by GEOID; subset for uploaded area; plot map, histogram, and summary of CVs

- Philly "NTAs"
- Select most popular ACS tables as test
- Use Spielman's heuristic to create "optimal NTAs"
- Aggregate tracts to "consensus NTAs" based on the overlap of existing neighborhood maps (majority rules!)
- Analyze differences

For each ACS table:
	a. Compute and plot estimates and CVs for optimal and consensus NTAs
	b. Look for excess smoothing (result of combining incompatible tracts) and test for differences before and after creating "NTAs"
	c. There will be other things to keep in mind here...TBD

Aspects of decision-making:
	a. Contiguity
	b. Compactness
	c. Similarity
	d. Natural barriers (water)
	e. Artificial barriers (highways)
	f. Auxiliary information (neighborhoods)
